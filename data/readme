# output of 3P-CLR on chimpanzee data - filtered to 3 columns
# contains 3 columns: chromosome position 3P-CLR score
# where position = physical position of the central SNP of the window
# note this file contains 3P-CLR scores genome-wide (for all windows for which the statistic was calculated)
# file used to plot Figure S12: Empirical distribution of 3P-CLR scores
  # to plot in R: 
  #fulldist<-fread("3pclr.scores.genomewide.chr.snpposition.1.txt")
  #ggplot(fulldist, aes(x=V3)) +  geom_histogram() +  labs(x="3P-CLR score", y = "Frequency") + theme_classic() + theme(text = element_text(size = 15))  + theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 15)) + geom_vline(xintercept = quantile(fulldist$V3, probs = c(0.995))) + geom_vline(xintercept = quantile(fulldist$V3, probs = c(0.999))) + geom_vline(xintercept = quantile(fulldist$V3, probs = c(0.9995)))
